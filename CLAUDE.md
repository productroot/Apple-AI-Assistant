# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a SwiftUI-based iOS/macOS application demonstrating Apple's Foundation Models framework for on-device AI. The project includes multiple demo apps:
- **Foundation Lab**: Main demo app showcasing various AI capabilities
- **Physiqa**: Health-focused AI assistant (previously "Body Buddy")
- **Psylean**: Pokémon analysis AI assistant
- **Murmer**: Experimental app

### Recent Updates (January 2025)
- **Tasks Management System**: Complete task management with Projects and Areas
  - Areas: Organizational containers for grouping related projects
  - Projects: Collections of tasks with deadlines and progress tracking
  - Drag & drop support for reordering Areas/Projects and assigning Projects to Areas
  - Inline creation/editing for both Areas and Projects
  - Swipe actions with confirmation dialogs for deletion
  - iCloud sync support for data persistence

```

### Key Patterns
- **MVVM Architecture**: Views bind to ViewModels using @Observable
- **AI Integration**: Uses FoundationModels framework with type-safe `@Generable` protocol
- **Tool System**: Extensible tools conforming to `Tool` protocol for AI capabilities
- **Platform Adaptive**: Shared codebase with platform-specific UI adaptations

### AI Tool System
Tools extend AI capabilities by conforming to `Tool` protocol:
- Weather (OpenMeteo API)
- Web Search (Exa AI - requires API key)
- Calendar, Contacts, Health, Location, Music, Reminders (iOS integrations)

### Model Configuration
- Models configured in `Models/ModelConfiguration.swift`
- Generation guides in `Models/GenerationGuides/`
- Streaming and async generation support

## Important Implementation Details

### Adding New Features
1. For new AI tools: Create in `Tools/` directory conforming to `Tool` protocol
2. For new views: Add to appropriate subdirectory in `Views/`
3. Update model configurations in `ModelConfiguration.swift` if needed

### Tasks System Implementation
- **Areas & Projects**: Hierarchical organization with Areas containing Projects
- **Drag & Drop**: Uses Transferable protocol with ProxyRepresentation for ID-based transfers
- **Inline Editing**: FocusState management for seamless creation/editing experience
- **Swipe Actions**: Delete and Edit with confirmation dialogs
- **State Management**: Multiple @State variables for creation/editing modes
- **iCloud Sync**: Automatic persistence through TasksViewModel

### API Keys
- Exa AI key needed for web search: Set in `Services/ExaService.swift`
- Keys should be stored securely, not committed to repository

### Platform Considerations
- Use `#if os(iOS)` for platform-specific code
- Test on both iOS and macOS targets
- Consider visionOS compatibility for new features

### Common Patterns
- Error handling for model unavailability
- Streaming response handling with AsyncStream
- Type-safe generation with Generable protocol
- Observable state management for real-time updates

### AI Prompt Management
- **All AI prompts must be centralized in `Models/AIPrompts.swift`**
- Never hardcode prompts directly in ViewModels or Views
- Use static methods in AIPrompts enum for different prompt types
- Include proper documentation for each prompt method
- Example:
  ```swift
  let prompt = AIPrompts.projectDescription(
      projectName: project.name,
      areaName: areaName,
      existingNotes: notes,
      deadline: deadline
  )
  ```

## Code Implementation Guidelines

### Avoid Mockup Functions
- **NEVER create placeholder or mockup functions** - all code should be fully functional
- Implement complete functionality for every method and computed property
- If external dependencies are needed, use real APIs or services
- For development/testing, use actual test data rather than hardcoded mockups

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Ensure all code works on both iOS and macOS** without modification
- Use platform-agnostic SwiftUI components when possible
- When platform-specific code is necessary:
  ```swift
  #if os(iOS)
  // iOS-specific implementation
  #elseif os(macOS)
  // macOS-specific implementation
  #endif
  ```
- Test UI layouts on both platforms to ensure proper rendering
- Use `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` for adaptive layouts
- Avoid UIKit/AppKit imports unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer SwiftUI native solutions over platform-specific frameworks

### Debugging and Monitoring
- **Add debugging logs to all key operations** for easy monitoring and troubleshooting
- Use descriptive log messages that include:
  - Operation being performed
  - Key parameters/data
  - Success/failure states
- Example pattern:
  ```swift
  func addProject(_ project: Project) {
      print("📝 Adding project: \(project.name) with ID: \(project.id)")
      print("   Area: \(project.areaId?.uuidString ?? "none")")
      projects.append(project)
      saveToiCloudIfEnabled()
      print("✅ Project added successfully")
  }
  ```
- Log categories to include:
  - Data operations (create, update, delete)
  - State changes
  - User interactions
  - Sync operations
  - Error conditions
- Use emoji prefixes for visual clarity:
  - 📝 for create/add operations
  - ✏️ for update operations
  - 🗑️ for delete operations
  - 🔄 for sync operations
  - ❌ for errors
  - ✅ for success confirmations

### Help Documentation Updates
- **EVERY new feature or feature change MUST include help documentation updates**
- When adding new functionality:
  - Update `Foundation Lab/Views/Settings/HelpTopicsView.swift` for general features
  - Update `Foundation Lab/Views/Settings/AIHelpView.swift` for AI-powered features
- Documentation must include:
  - Overview of the feature
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Tips and best practices
  - Common issues and solutions
- Example: When adding a new AI feature, add a new `AIFeatureCard` in AIHelpView
- Example: When modifying task behavior, update the relevant section in HelpTopicsView's `helpContent`

### Git Commit and Push Restrictions
- **NEVER commit and push changes without explicit user request**
- Only perform git operations when the user explicitly asks:
  - "Commit changes" or "Please commit"
  - "Push changes" or "Push to remote"
  - "Commit and push"
- If changes are ready but user hasn't requested commit:
  - Inform user that changes are complete
  - Wait for explicit commit/push instruction
- This ensures user maintains full control over version history
