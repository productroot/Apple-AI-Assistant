# Debugging Background Thread Publishing Warning

## Current Status

Despite fixing several locations where properties are updated from background threads, we still see the warning. The console shows:

```
Using CloudKit container: iCloud.io.productroot.assistant
Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed...
Custom zone created or already exists
iCloud setup completed successfully
```

## What We've Fixed

1. **CloudKit completion blocks**: Wrapped `serverChangeToken` updates in `@MainActor` tasks
2. **deleteAllData**: Wrapped `serverChangeToken = nil` in MainActor.run
3. **resetCloudKitConfiguration**: Wrapped entire method in `@MainActor` task
4. **iCloudEnabled setter**: Wrapped `setupiCloud()` call in `@MainActor` task

## Possible Remaining Issues

1. **Timer in debouncedSaveTasks**: Timer callbacks might run on background threads
2. **Property observers**: The @Observable macro might be generating property observers that run on background threads
3. **UserDefaults notifications**: Changes to UserDefaults might trigger observations on background threads

## Additional Observations

The warning appears immediately after "Using CloudKit container" and before "Custom zone created", suggesting it might be happening during initialization or in the computed property getters/setters.

## Next Steps

To fully resolve this, we should:
1. Add thread assertions to identify exactly which property is being updated
2. Consider making all property updates explicitly use MainActor
3. Review if @Observable is the right choice for a service that performs async operations
